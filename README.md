### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a research associate (postdoc) at the University of Liverpool. 

ðŸ”­ My research focuses on theoretical and practical aspects of computing with uncertainty. My areas of interest are: (1) rigorous inference from small-sized datasets with imprecise probability and robust Bayes; (2) propagation of uncertainty through complex computations; (3) code optimization on GPUs and super computers.

I am also interested in: mathematics-based animations, rigorous computing, computer-aided proofs, time-history data, neural ODEs, web-based research software. 

My research is helping casting more light on: * digital twins technology, * hard-to-diagnose diseases, * quantification of uncertainty in engineering and machine learning; the latter include: measurement uncertainty (stats & eng), population uncertainty (stats), input uncertainty (eng), truncation error (eng & cs), roundoff error (eng & cs), generalization error (ml & cs), confidence and prediction uncertainty (ml & cs).

<!--My research focuses on the rigorous and efficient bounding of computational codes via both intrusive and non-intrusive algorithms.

ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a Python library for the propagation of uncertainty characterised by gaps, due to lack of knowledge, limited sample size, limited measurement precision and more.-->

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: interval analysis, probability-bounds analysis, reliability analysis, diagnostic uncertainty, error propagation, senstivity analysis, belief networks.

ðŸŽ“ I hold a PhD in engineering from the University of Liverpool.
