### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Liverpool. 

My research focuses on the rigorous and efficient uncertainty propagation through computational codes via both intrusive and non-intrusive algorithms.

ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a Python library for the propagation of bounded (and unbounded) variables characterised by knowledge gaps.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: interval analysis, reliability analysis, diagnostic uncertainty, error propagation, senstivity analysis, belief networks.

ðŸŽ“ I hold a PhD in engineering from the University of Liverpool. 

ðŸ“« You can reach me by email at `marco.de-angelis`&#128231;`liverpool.ac.uk`
